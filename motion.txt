Advanced motion detection to stop background noise such as rain.

Parameters:
trigger_point = 300 # Level at which movement is detected.
trigger_point_base = 200 # Level at which movement is seen to cease.
movement_history_window = 10 # This is the number of past movements that are used to produce a mean movement level.
6,7,4,8,3,6,10,6,7,4,3 = 64/6.4 = 6

movement_history_age = 10 # Compare the average movement level against movement level 10 frames ago.
movement_frame_count = 7 # Number of consecutive frames where movement level is detected before triggering the recording.


Stop the rain:
Rain drops cause a peak in movement that spans around two frames so to elevate the peak get an average movement level.
If heavy rain comes the average can climb to a higher level that the trigger point.  So the combat this add the current
average movement level is added to the trigger point creating a variable trigger point. To trigger movement in this scenario
a movement_history_age has to be introduced to compare the average movement with the movement average movement_history_age ago.
